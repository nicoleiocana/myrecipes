# Myrecipes Project

_The best recipe sharing app!_ Myrecipes website created from
[Udemy's The Professional Ruby on Rails Developer with Rails 5](https://www.udemy.com/course/pro-ruby-on-rails-rails5/)
by Mashrur Hossain and Rob Percival. Additional components were added to the application:
likes functionality and images integration. This social experience capitalizes on
**ActionCable** with realtime features such as a chatroom and comments. Test Driven
Development (TDD) is implemented throughout the site building process. Other notable features:
* an authentication system built from scratch
* user interface (UI) styled with Bootstrap
* file/image hosting from Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* [Gravatars](https://en.gravatar.com/)
* model and non-model backed forms
* one-to-many and many-to-many associations at the database layer
